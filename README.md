# gene-panels #

Repository to share and compare gene panels.

## Format ##

Each panel will be in a csv format like
```#hgncid```

We plan to add more information like references for each gene etc.

We will try to keep a structure where each institute has it's own folder and in the folders all gene panels are collected.

We begin this initiative by sharing three gene panels in the ks (Karolinska Hospital) folder, these are:

- Inborn Errors of Metabolism (iem)
- Mitochondrial Nuclear (mt)
- Epilepsy (ep)
